Yes it's a _another_ todo list app. But this one comes with accounts and optimistic rendering. You can save it on your device like a PWA (while it's not technically one)
Made with Remix & Tailwind, hosted on cloudflare.

## How to run locally

Running the project proved to be **quite difficult**, actually. The cloudflare adapter for Remix has a bug that prevents live reload from working properly.
The current production branch is `cloudflare-pages`

You'll need to clone the project, run `npm i` then `npm run dev`.
